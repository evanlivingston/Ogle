## About

Ogle aims to help the average Internet user better understand their browsing experience, specifically their engagement with the imagery they see online. Wherever you go, Ogle sees and records the images you find, how many you see, their urls, and most interestingly, how long you've looked at which. 

The images are stored in an accessible manner right on your browser and arranged in order of the longest viewed images to the shortest. The app only shows the top 25 most viewed but it is saving all of the images for accuracy. The images are private and only stored locally on your browser.

Inspired by hysteria surrounding Internet use and alleged rises in ADD, a desire to engage more fully with imagery online, Surfcave by Brad Troemel, and my Tumblr Dashboard experience. Ogle will let us step back and see where we're really placing our attention.
